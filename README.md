# Sentiment analyzer on text

One of my college assignments required me to build a script that will be capapble of doing a sentiment analysis (no internal packages should be used by other developers). I have used a twitter tweets dataset that are built in to build a sentiment analyzer. The model was built using NaiveBayesClassifier.


### NOTE: Model is always built when script is being run (please make changes to functions depending on how often you need to build this model)
